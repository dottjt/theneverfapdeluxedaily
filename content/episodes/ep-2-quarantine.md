My question to you today is, dad keeps hitting me. I think it's cause he's always drunk. How can I get him to stop beating me?\"\n    Geez, Timmy. Fuck. I'm not a miracle worker. I can't unfuck your dad. Best advice I can give, is to kill yourself. Grab a gun. Run into traffic. Do what you have to. You know, it's worked for a countless number of people. Overdosing is really popular these days, so yeah.
