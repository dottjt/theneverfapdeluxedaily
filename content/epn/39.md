Diving Deeper Into Self-Criticism

- Here's the deal. Self-criticism is a coping mechanism.
- The reason why it's a coping mechanism is because it is a reaction we produce towards facing something difficult. Usually as a form of motivation for us to take action.
- So something bad happens, we react with self-criticism under the believe that it will make us change.
- On the other hand it's also an unhealthy coping mechanism because although it causes us to cope, it also causes a great deal of suffering. Self-criticising doesn't make us happy, it makes us feel awful.
- It's also unhealthy because it's generally ineffective. Rarely does it actually get us to change. It usually just makes us cynical and full of hate about ourselves. In particular it makes us judgemental.
- The thing with coping mechanisms though is that we don't pursue them because they work. We pursue them because that's what we learnt as a child.
- So what NFD is about, is identify and replacing these coping mechanisms with healthier coping mechanisms.
