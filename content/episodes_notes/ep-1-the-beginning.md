What do you want to achieve today?
You know, what is on your aciheve today list?

    

the_topic
It's largely a comedy podcast, that I think it secretly a motivational podcast. I want it to be silly. I also want it to serve as an internal forum for storytelling, discussion, expression, ambition, inspiration and everything else inbetween. Largely I want it to make you feel. 


Secondly, it's a marketing platform. I'm writing a novel at the moment, and I realised I need a marketing platform.

    

the_viewermail
Julius Reade from Melbourne, Australia.

"Hey Julius, loving the first show. Personal request, but I have a bit of a foot fetish. Would you be willing to suck my foot?"

Well Julius, usually I charge my clients for this kind of work. But just because I love you. Let's get that sock off.
