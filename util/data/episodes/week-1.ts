    notes: `\
It's largely a comedy podcast, that I think it secretly a motivational podcast. I want it to be silly. \
I also want it to serve as an internal forum for storytelling, discussion, expression, ambition, inspiration \
and everything else inbetween. Largely I want it to make you feel. \n

Secondly, it's a marketing platform. I'm writing a novel at the moment, and I realised I need a marketing platform.

"Hey Julius, loving the first show. Personal request, but I have a bit of a foot fetish. Would you be willing to suck my foot?"

Well Julius, usually I charge my clients for this kind of work. But just because I love you. Let's get that sock off.

    Geez, Timmy. Fuck. I'm not a miracle worker. I can't unfuck your dad. Best advice I can give, is to kill yourself. Grab a gun. Run into traffic. Do what you have to. You know, it's worked for a countless number of people. Overdosing is really popular these days, so yeah. Stay strong.

Erin, you're the reason I have clothes. Please don't throw that away. It's \
important to me, that you make my clothes.
